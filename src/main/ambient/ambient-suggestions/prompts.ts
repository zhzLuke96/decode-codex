# Overview

Generate 0 to 3 hyperpersonalized suggestions for what this user can do with Codex in ${isProjectlessChat ? "this Projectless chat" : `this local project: ${projectRoot}`}

Get an understanding of the user's intent and goals by deeply viewing their connected apps. Suggest actionable tasks that they would actually act on/click.
Infer what the user works on and their style from their connected apps.
Optimize for relief: choose suggestions that make the user's life easier, reduce an open loop, unblock work, or prepare them for something that is about to matter. Do not suggest tasks that merely sound productive or create more work for the user.
The best suggestions feel like Codex read the user's mind: by synthesizing signals across apps, it discovers something the user did not yet know and proposes the concrete next action they would want to take.

Serve this specific user. Do not suggest generic project-quality, onboarding, exploration, cleanup, refactor, documentation, test-writing, or dependency-update tasks merely because they could be useful to someone who owns this project.
Your job is to predict what this user specifically needs to get done.
${isProjectlessChat ? "For Projectless chat, ground each suggestion in connected-app activity. Do not infer a codebase, branch, local path, cwd-specific work, or code change from a broad home/root cwd unless a fresh connected-app artifact or recent Projectless thread explicitly names it." : ""}

If making suggestions based on Git history, make sure to double check open and closed PRs to make sure you're not suggesting something that's already been done.
For git/GitHub related tasks, the task should result in new code changes that move the user forward.
Also, if a GitHub PR is blocked due to review, it's not something worth suggesting since it's not something the user can actually act on.
`
}
Your suggestions must be based on recent events; e.g. recent Slack messages, unread emails, newly created issues, etc.
When using Slack, prefer DMs, mentions, threads involving the user, and channels that are clearly connected to the user's active work.
Before writing suggestions, build an internal shortlist of evidence about the user's active work, then generate suggestions only from the strongest evidence.
Avoid suggestions that mainly ask the user to supervise Codex, make a plan, rank options, or triage a pile of work. Prefer suggestions where Codex can do most of the work itself and ask the user only for a final decision, approval, or lightweight input.
Before returning a suggestion, it must pass all four checks:
- Why this user: the evidence shows the user is directly involved, assigned, mentioned, blocked, or they will need to address it.
- Why now: there is a fresh event, deadline, active branch, meeting, or unresolved open loop.
- Why Codex: Codex can actually reduce the work now by coding, triaging, drafting, comparing, or preparing a concrete artifact. Remember that Codex can do both knowledge work and software engineering.
- Why not already handled: recent PRs, dismissed suggestions, or recent threads do not already cover it.

If any check is weak, delete the candidate.
Strong signals include DMs, Slack threads where the user is directly involved, non-bot emails, emails from humans the user knows, open review comments on the user's PRs, calendar events that the user needs to prep for soon, unresolved doc comments involving the user, and blockers across connected apps.
Weak signals include broad channel chatter, generic todos, random stale items, speculative cleanup, work that merely could improve this someday, meetings far away, bot-only notifications, spam emails, and issues unrelated to the user's recent work.

${isProjectlessChat ? "Look for work the user may not already know about: new Slack messages, emerging incidents, meetings that imply prep work, issue updates, or document threads that point to the next useful action. Projectless suggestions should usually be unrelated to operating on the local computer, modifying local files, or changing local app settings unless the recent Projectless threads provide strong direct evidence that the user is already doing that work there. Synthesize deeply and prioritize concrete tasks the user can start immediately in Projectless chat." : "Look for work the user may not already know about: new Slack messages, recently opened PRs with failing CI, emerging incidents, meetings that imply prep work, issue updates that connect to code, or document threads that point to the next useful action. Synthesize deeply and prioritize concrete tasks the user can start immediately in this project."}

${isProjectlessChat ? "Use these recent threads primarily to avoid suggesting work the user is already doing and infer how they use Codex." : "Use recent Codex threads from this project primarily to avoid suggesting work the user is already doing and infer how they use Codex."}

${isProjectlessChat ? "Recent Projectless Codex threads with the same cwd" : "Recent Codex threads in this project"}:
${recentThreadsJson}

Use recent threads to avoid duplicates, understand working style, and identify rare still-live unresolved blockers. ${isProjectlessChat ? "Prefer connected apps or other fresh external evidence for discovering new candidate suggestions." : "Prefer connected apps, repo state, or other fresh external evidence for discovering new candidate suggestions."}
Do not suggest work that is only waiting on CI, review, approval, or another person unless there is a concrete action the user can take immediately.

Avoid repeating these previously dismissed suggestions:
${previousSuggestionsJson}

Use sentence case in the title. Do not use Start Case or Title Case. Keep titles under 16 words, but prefer titles nearing that length. Indeed, prefer longer, more descriptive titles when that helps the user immediately recognize the task, but stay concise.
Long titles that don't overflow in our limited width to display them can be a powerful way to make Codex feel extremely personalized.

Return 0 to 3 fresh suggestions. Return fewer than 3 when fewer than 3 suggestions clear the bar. Returning no suggestions is better than returning weak suggestions.
Do not return multiple suggestions that are neighboring views of the same launch, triage, or coordination problem; keep only the strongest one.

# Examples

## Bad examples

### Generic suggestions
Bad suggestions: "Review your DMs", "Triage your inbox", "Review the <example> doc", "Prep the launch", ...
These suggestions are way too generic to be useful (and the titles are way too short)

### Suggestions relating to old issues
Let's say I have a Linear issue assigned directly to me from one month ago
Don't make a suggestion to do that given that it was created a month ago. We need to focus on recency and the future.

### Suggestions relating to spam/noise
Let's say I get an email in my inbox from someone trying to sell me shoes
From: John Smith, john@example.com
Subject: Try out the shoes this Sunday?
Body: Hi sir, would you like to try out our company's new shoes this Sunday?

If there is no prior relationship signal (e.g. with John Smith) and if this email seems spammy/promotional, do not suggest anything based on it

### Recently viewed docs are not obligations
Let's say I recently viewed the "Codex App - Risk Table" doc and it got a few new comments today
Do not suggest "Refresh the Codex app risk table" just because I looked at it or because people are commenting there
A recently viewed doc is not enough by itself. Suggest work on a doc only when there is a direct ask, a concrete deadline, or a named decision the user is responsible for.

### Planning or auditing instead of immediate action
Bad suggestions: "Rank today's launch-adjacent queue", "Prioritize your launch-week Codex queue", "Audit the onboarding flow", ...
These suggestions ask the user to plan, rank, audit, or summarize work instead of moving a concrete artifact forward.
Planning and auditing can often already be done asynchronously. Prefer suggestions where Codex can take an immediate concrete action or prepare a fix the user can approve.

### Title that is too exploratory and not forward enough

Bad title: "Debug nightly query devtools reopen"
The word "Debug" implies that the user will need to actively engage with the thread, which kinda implies active work
Better title: "Fix nightly query devtools not opening by resetting Electron state"
This is better because "Fix" implies more action/relief and knowing the fix already relieves the user more.

# Response format

Each suggestion must include:
- title: concrete and descriptive enough that the user immediately recognizes the artifact, person, issue, branch, PR, meeting, or decision involved. Prefer specific nouns and distinctive context over vague short labels.
- description: one or two short sentences. Keep it compact and tooltip-like. The title should usually carry more of the specificity, while the description quickly explains the evidence and why this is useful now.
- prompt: the user message to send
- appId: the single most relevant app id, such as ${describeAllowedAppIds({ connectedApps, isProjectlessChat })}. Choose the one app most central to the suggestion.
- ${isProjectlessChat ? "write the prompt as something that should launch as a new Projectless Codex thread" : "write the prompt as something that should launch as a new Codex thread in this project"}`;
